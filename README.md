# CS-584-Machine-Learning-Project
This repository contains the New York City Taxi Demand Prediction project

This project aims to predict the demand for taxis in New York City (NYC) based on historical data.
Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the number of taxi pickups in NYC for a given time and location. The model will be trained on historical data of taxi pickups and other relevant features, such as weather, traffic, and holidays. The predicted demand can be used by taxi companies to allocate their resources efficiently and to improve their services.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data, which contains detailed information about taxi trips in NYC, including pickup and dropoff times, locations, fare, and other details. The dataset can be downloaded from the NYC TLC website.
